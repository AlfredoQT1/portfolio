You will be able to have an insight of what I like to do, how I am outside school, and what I've done over the years
                                that has helped me grow as a person. I hope you enjoy it! Thank you!</p>

                            <p class="text-justify" style="padding-left:10%;padding-right:10%;">In my free time my favorite thing to do is listen to music, I love discovering new tunes to listen to. When people ask me what my favorite band is, I don't/can't seem to answer that, as I firmly believe that each song has the
                                ability of being great, even if the artists aren't so.
                                <br/> Another of my hobbies is playing videogames. I absolutely LOVE videogames, and not in the conventional way. Not only do I like to play and learn, but I am intrigued by the programming behind them. In my free time
                                I normally listen to music while trying to figure out how the algorithms of a certain "boss battle" work.
                                <br/> Finally, what I would consider my other big hobby is (as cliché as it sounds) learning. Yes! I know, so unoriginal and very used already. Nevertheless it's true, I enjoy learning very much. I don't limit myself to
                                learn about a single subject... if I find or read about something interesting, the next thing I know is that I've spent the last 3 hours researching about bananas. To be honest, I like to research, I take my time and I
                                am very thorough, which can come in very handy when programming or working with maths.</p>

                                I was enrolled in extracurricular classes such as piano lessons and drama class. As Paul Klee once said, “One eye sees, the other feels.” I have fun when I play, I have fun when I act. Those small details, each different key or each different movement,
                                involved in these activities, have helped me let go of my problems and hold on to the good feelings.
                                <br/> I’ve also had many different significant experiences regarding sport-related extracurricular activities. One of the things I love to do is to swim. I was part of a swimming team back in Monterrey, I got to participate
                                in a National competition and several state and regional competitions. I was also part of an American Football team back in Monterrey, and was invited to play several times to an cup here in the US.

                                For the years 2013-2015 I was part of a small group of people that went into different orphanages and resting homes in order to help in whatever thing they needed. 3 hours a week on Saturdays, 7 weeks per semester. This included: Casa Hogar Douglas, Asilo
                                Virgen de Guadalupe, and Casa Hogar para Ancianitos María Esperanza Nuestra.

                                During the summer of 2015, I went to study abroad in Heidelberg, Germany. I took for two months an intensive German course, 8 hours a day 5 days a week. It was a really fun experience, I got to meet a lot of people from around the world. I am still in
                                contact with most of them, friends from India, Spain, Korea, and Germany. It was a great opportunity to interact with other cultures, and to learn to work with others.
