                        Dear reader, <br/> Hello! My name is Alfredo Quezada, I'm a third year Marine Biology Major and Marine Sciences Minor at University of California at San Diego (UCSD). I am thrilled that you came here to my portfolio to find out
                        more about me, so let me tell you a bit of my background. This will just be an introductory statement so you can start getting to know me, if you wish to skip to the "important" parts, feel free to click in the navigation bar above
                        (or just scroll down) to quickly go to where you want to.
                        <br/><br/>I was born in Pharr, Texas, but I come from Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico, where I have lived most (if not all) of my life. Ever since I was younger I've had a big interest in mathematics, and when I got into my highschool's
                        International Baccalaureate program, my love for physics and programming flourished as well. Some of my biggest projects this last few years have been in developing software for an organization back in Mexico, and for a Research
                        Center here at UCSD. I think that some of my biggest achievements so far have been being able to come to the US to study, being really good at mathematics, knowing how to code in over 6 programming languages, and being part of
                        the work opportunities I've been part of.
                        <br/><br/>So thank you! For being here, I really hope you find me interesting. Feel free to navigate now to whatever you want to learn about me. Just so it's easier for you to navigate through my portfolio: my INDEX page contains
                        information regarding my work experiences, projects, etc., my ABOUT ME page is so you can get to know me better as a person (and contains my Resume), and the CONTACT ME page contains my personal information if you have any further
                        questions.

                        I am currently studying Marine Biology with a Marine Sciences Minor. I would really love to stay at UCSD but with my family's current financial situation, it isn't as easy as it sounds. This of course, isn't all bad news. Since my family is currently
                        at a tight spot financially, I am open to any way to help them, and therefore am available for work opportunities anywhere in the country (as long as I can afford travelling and staying there).
                        <br/> As for the near future, I am currently working as a Reasearch Assistant here at UCSD's EDRTC, but I am also actively searching for internship opportunities over the summer, as well as jobs at Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
                        My working interests include Selachimorpha research and conservation, Cetacean Acoustics, Marine Microbiology, Parasitology, mathematical modelling, and Paleobiology. I am open to both field and desk work. Feel free to contact
                        me if you believe I am your organization/company's material.
                        <br/> As mentioned before, I will start looking into a minor opportunity next year in Marine Biology, since it's something I've always wanted to do. I am not currently looking for a full time job, but it's something I would love

                    within the neurosciences and brain imaging department of the Research center.
                    <br/> I’m building a program for the center that is able to display patient’s test results based on several arithmetic processes, that I’m translating from another coding language into Java, that depend on patients’ answers to several
                    questionnaires regarding their recovering process of eating disorders.</p>

                    a program to store all files, and helping create a more efficient working environment.
                    <br/> At Comenzar de Nuevo I built a program that was able to help doctors keep track of their input and output of patients' medications more effectively. I created a database where doctors could input values, set alarms for when supplies
                    were low, pull information, and overall work more efficiently than before.

                    I get most of my inspiration from my parents. Being part of a family of 5 is not easy: all males (except for my mom), having 2 of them studying in another country, and this year having both of them in college? There's just not enough words to express
                    how much my parents have sacrificed for us. I just hope that one day I can start taking care of them for a change, and I'm hoping that this opportunity of studying in the U.S. helps me achieve that. Above experience, money, relationships,
                    and everything else I can possibly imagine, all I want is to be able to support and help my family.
